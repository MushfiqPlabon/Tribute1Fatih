          Mehmed II (Ottoman Turkish: محمد ثانى‎, romanized: Meḥmed-i sānī;
          Turkish: II. Mehmet, pronounced [icinˈdʒi ˈmehmet]; 30 March 1432 –
          3 May 1481), commonly known as Mehmed the Conqueror (Ottoman
          Turkish: ابو الفتح‎, romanized: Ebū'l-Fetḥ, lit. 'The Father of
          Conquest'; Turkish: Fatih Sultan Mehmet), was an Ottoman Sultan who
          ruled from August 1444 to September 1446, and then later from
          February 1451 to May 1481. In Mehmed II's first reign, he defeated
          the crusade led by John Hunyadi after the Hungarian incursions into
          his country broke the conditions of the truce Peace of Szeged. When
          Mehmed II ascended the throne again in 1451 he strengthened the
          Ottoman navy and made preparations to attack Constantinople. At the
          age of 21, he conquered Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) and
          brought an end to the Byzantine Empire.

        <p>
          After the conquest Mehmed claimed the title "Caesar" of the Roman
          Empire (Qayser-i Rûm), based on the fact that Constantinople had
          been the seat and capital of the surviving Eastern Roman Empire
          since its consecration in 330 AD by Emperor Constantine I.[4] The
          claim was only recognized by the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
          Nonetheless, Mehmed II viewed the Ottoman state as a continuation of
          the Roman Empire for the remainder of his life, seeing himself as
          "continuing" the Empire rather than "replacing" it. This assertion
          was eventually abandoned by his successors
        </p>

          Mehmed continued his conquests in Anatolia with its reunification
          and in Southeast Europe as far west as Bosnia. At home he made many
          political and social reforms, encouraged the arts and sciences, and
          by the end of his reign, his rebuilding program had changed
          Constantinople into a thriving imperial capital. He is considered a
          hero in modern-day Turkey and parts of the wider Muslim world. Among
          other things, Istanbul's Fatih district, Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge
          and Fatih Mosque are named after him.
